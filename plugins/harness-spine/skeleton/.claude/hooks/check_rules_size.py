"""PostToolUse nudge: warn when a governed instruction file exceeds the soft line budget.

Contract — this hook is the template every other hook in this project follows.
See `.claude/rules/enforcement.md` -> Hook contracts.

  Event     PostToolUse only. It ADVISES and never denies; denial belongs to PreToolUse.
  Governed  `.claude/rules/*.md` and the root `CLAUDE.md` (see GOVERNED).
  Input     None. It SCANS the governed set and never reads the payload — see below.
  Silence   Means exactly one thing: every governed file was read and is within budget.
            Anything that stopped the check from running says so in one line instead of
            passing quietly, so "all clear" and "never looked" stay distinguishable.
  Failure   Never blocks, never raises. An unreadable file exits 0 with a note.
  Advisory  Detection is deterministic; the fix is judgment, so this reports and lets the
            author choose — see `workflow.md` -> File size budget.
  Tests     `test_check_rules_size.py`, beside this file: must-block and must-pass halves.

WHY IT SCANS INSTEAD OF READING `tool_input.file_path`
    Keying on the payload path meant the nudge only ever saw Write / Edit / MultiEdit. A rules
    file changed through `sed`, a heredoc, or a `python3` one-liner slipped past in silence,
    and a session doing its edits through the shell tripped the hook exactly never. Recovering
    a path by parsing shell commands is the fragile alternative; scanning is not. The governed
    set is under twenty short files, so a full pass costs nothing, and a clean tree prints
    nothing — the nudge stays silent until some file is actually over budget, whoever put it
    there and however it was written. Wire the matcher to include `Bash` for the same reason.

KNOWN GAP (state it rather than let it pass quietly)
    GOVERNED does not walk the tree, so a nested `CLAUDE.md` in a subdirectory is not scanned.
    Add its pattern to GOVERNED if this project has one.

This file is project-agnostic; it ships verbatim in every project the harness scaffolds.
Do not hand-edit it here — reconcile with the `harness-spine:update` skill so the copies do not
drift. If this project deliberately diverges, say why in this docstring.
Tune BUDGET below if a project wants a different soft cap.
