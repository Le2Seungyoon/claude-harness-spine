"""Scanner: every file a rules file points at must exist.

Run: python3 .claude/scripts/check_rule_links.py     (exit 1 on findings)

The CLAUDE.md rules table and the cross-references between rules files are the only delivery
mechanism the harness has, so **a stale path there is a rule nobody is told to read**. Nothing
else notices: the prose still reads correctly, and the reader simply never arrives.

`workflow.md` -> File size budget actively creates this risk — option (1) Relocate says to move
a section and "leave a one-line pointer behind", and option (2) Split creates a new file others
must now reference. This is the check that keeps those pointers honest.

Why a script and not a hook (`enforcement.md` -> Four layers): a rules file is routinely edited
in an IDE, and a pointer breaks when a file is *renamed or deleted* — which is not an edit any
PostToolUse hook observes on the file that names it. This belongs in the test/CI layer; wire it
into the project's suite (`testing.md` -> Invariant tests) so it runs on every authoring path.

FALSE-POSITIVE SCOPING (`enforcement.md` -> Before promoting a check to deny). Deliberately
narrow, because a checker that flags prose gets deleted:
  - Only tokens ending in .md / .py / .json / .sh — harness-internal references. A directory
    (`docs/`), a config file the project may not have yet (`.env.template`), and a bare English
    word are all out of scope by construction.
  - Anything containing a glob, a placeholder, or an angle-bracket is a PATTERN, not a path.
  - A bare filename resolves against the places harness files live, so `settings.json` and
    `workflow.md` are found without every reference having to spell out a full path.
  - A backticked path WRAPPED ACROSS A LINE BREAK is not matched at all (the regex is
    newline-free), so it reads as a pointer and is checked by nothing. Judge a new pointer by the
    `N references` count moving, never by the CLEAN verdict alone.
Measured on the shipped skeleton: 0 findings. Re-measure before tightening any of the above.

This file ships in every project the harness scaffolds. Its LOGIC is project-agnostic, with one
deliberate exception: the source roots in `SEARCH_DIRS` are filled per project. That line is
expected to differ and is NOT drift — `harness-spine:update` reconciles around it, never onto it.
Everything else: do not hand-edit here; reconcile with that skill so the copies do not drift. If
this project diverges anywhere beyond the source roots, say why in this docstring.
