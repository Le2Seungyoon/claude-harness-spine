"""Tests for check_rule_links.py — run: python3 test_check_rule_links.py

A scanner is code, so it ships with a test (`enforcement.md` -> Hook contracts). The must-pass
half carries the weight here: this check reads prose, so its whole risk is flagging something
that was never a path. Every scoping decision in the scanner's docstring has a case below.

Stdlib only, no test runner — it must be verifiable in a freshly scaffolded repo.
